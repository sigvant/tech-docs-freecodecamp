          Call Of Duty: Warzone (CODWZ for short) has the following classes of weapons:
        </p>
        
          <ul>
            <li>Pistols</li>
            <li>Sub Machine Guns (SMGs)</li>
            <li>Shotguns</li>
            <li>Assault Rifles (ARs)</li>
            <li>Light Machine Guns (LMGs)</li>
            <li>Tactical Rifles</li>
            <li>Marksman Rifles</li>
            <li>Sniper Rifles</li>
            <li>Launchers</li>
            <li>Melees</li>
  
          </ul>
        
        <p>
          Each weapon class has their base stats, for example, LMGs have lower mobility than
          SMGs. And each weapon inside a class has variations of those statuses due to standard and due to
          player setup.
        </p>
        <p>
          For the purpose of this tutorial, we will address weapon usage according to situations, providing explanations
          on why each class performs better or worse.

            In short, CODWZ has 5 differente engagement ranges.
            
            <ul>
            <li>Point Blank (< 3m)</li>
            <li>Short Range (3m to 10m)</li>
            <li>Medium Range (10m to 50m)</li>
            <li>Long Range (50m to 100m)</li>
            <li>Sniping Range (> 100m)</li>
            </ul>
            
          </p>
  
          <p>
            Weapons usually fall in one range. For example, Melees should be used for Point Blank fights. Snipers 
            should be used for Sniping Range fights. But due to loadout builds, weapons might be more versatile. They can be modified to fit different ranges or even change ranges completely. Due to bullet damage drop over distance, it is imperative that you choose the right weapon for the engagement you are going into. This difference in range efficiency might be what is bringing your success rates down.
          </p>
          <code>When you are inside a building, go for short range weaponry.</code>
          <p>
            Knowing when to reach for your secondary in a gunfight is a skill that takes time to master but definitely pays off. If you are struggling to win closed quarter fights, consider using shotguns or smgs in hipfire mode.
          </p>
  
          <code>When engaged by an opponent with range specific weaponry advantage, always look for another position.</code>
        
          <p>
            Overall, assault rifles are the first weapon of choice because they cover different ranges without losing much efficiency. If you are going for an assault rifle, go for the one with highest damage if you are good dealing with recoil. If you can't, go for the ones with the largest control stat.

        <article>
          <p>Acquiring targets is easy on lower ranges and hard on highest ranges. Your specs might provide you with a tough time identifying players hiding far away in the scenario as well. Follow the guidelines listed below to increase your chances of acquiring targets effetively.</p>
          
          <ul>
            <li>In teamplay, always mark your targets</li>
            <li>First center your screen, then go Iron Sights</li>
            <li>Aim for the chest, recoil will bring you to the head</li>
            <li>Pay attention to the damage indicators, they will guide you</li>
            <li>Look for cover and the 'head glitch' (shooting behind covers)</li>
            <li>If the enemy gets too close, melee or hipfire</li>
            <li>Try to 'pretend' escape to lure your enemy in</li>
            <li>High ground is valuable</li>
            <li>Use your throwables to assist in the fights (stuns are effective)</li>
            <li>Change your controls to ADS on tap. It will free your finger for aiming</li>
            <li>Pay attention to the minimap to know if you are being shot from high ground</li>
            <li>Use VANTs to improve your manhunting skills. Mark the minimap after using</li>
          </ul>
  
          <p>Those tips may help you a lot in identifying targets and acquiring then effectively, however, good usage of your weapons ranges and setups will provide you with an easier control during ADS so you can track running targets. A final tip. If you were targeted, flip positions, hide or run - time to kill in CODWZ is too low, if you try to engage after already being engaged you will rarely win.</p>

          <p>
            Remember that weapon classes have different mobility. If you need to move fast through the terrain try to use your SMG or Pistol. A good technique is to use SMG for your gameplay to develop your overall ability to use the terrain around you. Mobility and flanking is a very interesting concept in CODWZ, and SMG offer you the most movement and damage combo in order to swing your position effectively.
          </p>
          <code>Usually movement increases in the following direction:
                fists, melee, pistols > smg, shotgun > AR, tactical rifles, marksman rifles, sniper rifles > LMG, Launchers</code>
          <p>
            It's totally ok to play with heavy weapons, but adapt your playstile accordingly.

            Usually it is not recommended to engage enemies with melees in any range except point blank. They can be used inside buildings or when approaching enemies from behind or the sides. It is useful to melee enemies when droping over then with parachutes. During a fight, if you manage to melee your downed opponent, you will save ammo in case another enemy shows up quickly.
